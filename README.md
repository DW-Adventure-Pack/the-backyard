# The Backyard

[The Backyard](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/121747-the-backyard/) is a casual, light-hearted roleplay thread, situated in Doomworld. with a generally consistent storyline, and open for anyone and everyone to join, little to no setup, no dice needed!... Ahem.

This repository serves as a single place to keep track of the storyline outline, as well as an archive and a new home for the character sheet.

## Outline

- `characters` – A folder with the characters in the story, each in AsciiDoc format. *Useful to remember who's who, who plays who, and also who diddles who I guess. Maybe not that last part.*

- `archive` – An archive of each post in the saga. *For posterity!*

– `outline` – A succint outline of each page in the story. *Use this to catch up to speed with new developments in the story.*
